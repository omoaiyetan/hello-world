# hello-world
Getting familiar with GitHub 


Here to improve my programming skills and learn new skills too.
Goal would be to get accustommed to this platform within a short while.

Daily dedication to this platform to understand working patterns of others and learn from how each developer is working


Willing to put in some free time for voluntary and testing work to improve own skills
